🚇 Delhi Metro Network Analysis

A data analytics project focused on understanding the structure, expansion, and spatial layout of the Delhi Metro — one of India’s largest rapid transit systems.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs geospatial mapping, visual analysis, and pattern identification using Python.

📌 Project Overview

The Delhi Metro has expanded rapidly over the past two decades.
This project explores:

How the metro network has geographically evolved

Which lines have the highest number of stations

Average distances between stations on each line

Year-wise expansion trends

Distribution of station layouts (Elevated, Underground, At-Grade)

The goal is to transform raw metro data into meaningful insights and clear visualizations.

🗂️ Features Included

✔ Interactive Delhi Metro Map (Folium)
✔ Year-wise station openings using bar charts
✔ Comparison of metro lines (station count + distance)
✔ Average distance between stations analysis
✔ Station layout distribution visualization
✔ Clean and structured Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Plotly

Folium

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Visuals

The notebook contains:

Full Delhi Metro network map with color-coded lines

Annual growth chart showing expansion phases

Station count vs. average distance comparison

Layout distribution chart

These visualizations help interpret how the network has grown and how station planning varies across different lines.
